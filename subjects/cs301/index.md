- !!**Root Cause Analysis**!!
  - It focuses on the problems first rather than the solutions.
- !!**Duration Analysis**!!
  - Requires a detailed examination of the amount of time it takes to perform each process in the current *as-is* system.
  - In here, you recreate a scenario with different methods and set time on each process to see the fastest way.
- !!**Activity-Based Costing**!!
  - Unlike duration analysis where we measure time, here, we estimate the cost associated with each process.
  - Assigning value is simple; you just examine the direct cost of labor and materials for each input.

  - It refers to studying how other organizations perform a business process to learn how your organization can do something better.
- !!**Outcome Analysis**!!
  - Focuses on understanding the primary outcomes that provide value to customers.
- !!**Technology Analysis**!!
  - Starts by having the analyst and managers develop a list of essential and exciting technologies. Then the group systematically identifies how each technology could be applied to the business process and determines how the business would benefit it.
- !!**Activity Elimination**!!
  - The analyst and managers work together to identify how the organization could eliminate each activity in the business process, how the function could operate without it, and what effects could likely occur.

---

### !!Functional Requirements!!
- Statements of services the system should provide.
- How the system should react to inputs.
- How the system should behave in situations.

---

### !!Non-Functional Requirements!!

  - Following feasibility study is the requirements elicitation and analysis, and requirements specification.
- !!**Software Design and Implementation**!!
  - Focuses on executing the system specification into an executable system.
  - Before development, you will also be doing the following:
    - Architectural design
    - Interface design
    - Component design
    - Database design
  - At this stage, client is not interested in this technicality, but as software engineers and software developers, this is crucial because these designs are a lot closer to how you perform your development.
- !!**Software Validation**!!
  - Focuses on implementing test strategies that were previously planned.
  - It is simply the testing of the output of the previous stage.
  - It's not purely testing. You must learn how to plan how you conduct your testing.
  - Here, you will also apply different types of testing such as component-based or system testing.
  - The final process here will be acceptance testing by using actual user data to validate if it is the same output/experience-based on the test data.
- !!**Software Evolution**!!
  - Focuses on the maintenance after system implementation.
  - This refers to the maintenance of the system. As explained before, one of the attributes of good software is maintainability.
  - In incremental models and agile development, this is very much in use because you are already planning which among the remaining features will be on the next iteration.

### !!System Design!!
- It is partitioning the requirements to hardware and software establishing an overall system architecture.

---

### !!Software Design!!
- It represents the software system functions in a form that can be transformed into one or more executable programs.

> To clarify, requirements define the function of the system from the client's viewpoint while system and software design describes the system from the software developer's viewpoint.

> When doing the system and software design, the client's representatives with no background in designing technicality need not be present during the discussion because they will not appreciate it.

### !!Systems Integration!!
- The process of bringing together the component sub-systems into one system and ensuring that sub-systems function together as a system.

---

### Software Process Models
- !!**Waterfall**!!
  - Has 5 phases or processes:
    - !!Phase 1: Requirements specification!!
      - The services, constraints, and goals are established in detail and serve as a system specification.
    - !!Phase 2: Software design!!
      - Identifying the requirements for either hardware or software and have an overall system architecture, system abstraction, and relationship.
      - This is where your architectural details, UML knowledge, Entity Relationship Diagram, and data flow diagrams will be used.
    - !!Phase 3: Implementation and unit testing!!
      - This stage is where programmers of software developers turn the design into the program.
      - If you are implementing Object-Oriented, part of this stage is to perform unit testing of each object.
    - !!Phase 4: Integration and system testing!!
      - Since from the previous stage, the process was to perform **unit test**, in this stage you are integrating different processes of the system to see if all requirements are met.
    - !!Phase 5: Operation and maintenance!!
      - The system is installed and put into use while at the same time fixing issues that were overlooked during the testing.
  - If you notice, they are synonyms of the 4 fundamental processes. What makes it famous though is how it performs those processes.
  - In this model, each phase should not start until the previous phase has finished. To indicate the phase is finished, it needs to have a "signed-off" document.
  - It needs to close the previous process before it can proceed to the next process.
- !!**Incremental Development**!!
  - Implements versioning by delivering functionalities in iterations.
  - It is based on the idea of developing an initial implementation *(with most functionality)*, exposing it to users for comments, and evolving it through several versions.
  - Has 3 benefits:
    - !!Customer change!!
      - The cost of accommodating customer requirements is reduced which means that the software can adapt to changes unlike in waterfall where there is no way of going back to the previous process.
      - In this model, the feedback can be carried over to the next release.
    - !!Easier customer feedback!!
      - Customers find it easier to comment on demonstration than that from software design documents.
    - !!Usefulness of product!!
      - Customers can use and gain value from the software earlier than waterfall process.
- !!**Reuse-oriented Software Engineering**!!
  - Uses existing components and integrates them into the system.
  - This approach is based on the existence of a significant number of reusable components. The process focuses on integrating these components into a system rather than developing from scratch.
  - This means that some part of what we are trying to build is already available either paid or free.
  - Has 4 stages:
    - !!Stage 1: Component analysis!!
      - In this stage, you will find out that when searching for components, usually there is no exact match, therefore only some functionalities are available.
    - !!Stage 2: Requirement modification!!
      - Requirements are modified based on requirements specifications. If modification is not available or not possible, a step may go back to component analysis.
    - !!Stage 3: System design with reuse!!
      - The framework of the system is designed considering the components that are reused. This means revisiting the design and incorporate the changes to reused components.
    - !!Stage 4: Development and integration!!
      - Systems that cannot be externally procured is developed. Components are integrated to create a new system or putting all the pieces. 
- !!**Prototyping**!!
  - It is an initial version of a software system that is used to demonstrate concepts.
  - This is usually used to check the feasibility of a proposed design.
- !!**Spiral Model**!!
  - It has the disadvantage of being expensive due to its long period of designing, developing, and implementation.
  - This model is not applicable to small projects due to its complexity in framework.
  - By Boehm (1988)
  - Its strength and the main difference between other models is its recognition of risks. This allows every loop to incorporate the following risks.
  - Has 4 sectors:
    - !!Sector 1: Objective setting!!
      - As early at this stage, you identify the possible risks and possible alternative same with constraints on the process of the products.
    - !!Sector 2: Risk assessment and reduction!!
      - For each risk identified from sector 1, make a detailed analysis and list down the steps to reduce the risks. You can incorporate a prototype to show that risk is reduced or avoided.
    - !!Sector 3: Development and validation!!
      - Perform development and validation by implementing different types of testing and plan and release the iteration.
    - !!Sector 4: Planning!!
      - Review of the project and check remaining items as well as check on the recently released iteration for improvement.
  - Advantages:
    - !!Risk handling!!
    - !!Good for large projects!!
    - !!Flexibility in requirements!!
    - !!Customer satisfaction!!
  - Disadvantages:
    - !!Complex!!
    - !!Expensive!!
    - !!Too much dependable on risk analysis!!
    - !!Difficulty in time management!!
- !!**Rational Unified Process**!!
  - Like other software process models, it is risk-driven, use-cased, architecture-centric, and iterative.
  - It also combines prototyping and incremental delivery.
  - Phase model that identifies 4 discrete phases:
    - !!Phase 1: Inception!!
      - Outputs: Objective statement, initial use case, risk assessment, project plan, prototypes, and models.
    - !!Phase 2: Elaboration!!
      - Outputs: Complete use case, architecture, project development plan, prototypes for tackling risks, user manual.
    - !!Phase 3: Construction!!
      - Outputs: Fully completed software system (this includes initial testing), user manual.
    - !!Phase 4: Transition!!
      - Outputs: Beta testing, training of users, and rollout or project deployment.

### 3 Types of Software Components
- !!**Web Services**!!
  - A component that can be reused because of its flexibility in the web environment.
  - This made significant advancement in the reuse-oriented model because it is very flexible and easy to implement.
- !!**Stand-alone Software**!!
  - A component that can be configured to work in a specific environment.
  - Normally this component is part of the hardware for integration purposes.
  - Examples are SDKs to allow the other hardware to communicate with your software.
- !!**Object Collection**!!
  - Developed as a package to be integrated into frameworks such as .NET or J2EE. Example is the package to manage the database connection.

### !!Agile Software Development!!
- Focuses on managing iterative approach rather than technical approaches.
- Its methods rely heavily on incremental approach to software specification, development, and delivery.

---

### Principles of Agile Methods
- !!**Customer involvement**!!
  - Customer should be closely involved throughout the development process.
- !!**Increment delivery**!!
  - Software is developed in increments with the customer specifying the requirements to be included.
- !!**People not process**!!
  - Team members should be left to develop their own ways of working without prescriptive processes.
- !!**Embrace change**!!
  - Expect the system requirements to change and so design the system to accommodate these changes.
- !!**Maintain simplicity**!!
  - Focus on simplicity in both the software being developed and in the development process. 
  - Wherever possible, eliminate complexity from the system.
