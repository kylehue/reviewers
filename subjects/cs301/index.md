- Byproduct of software engineering.

> A good software should deliver the required functionality and performance to the user and should be !!**maintainable**!!, !!**dependable and secured**!!, !!**efficient**!!, and !!**acceptable**!!.

---

### 2 Types of Software
- !!System Software (OS, Firmware, Drivers)!!
- !!Application Software (Browsers, MS Office products, MySQL or Oracle)!!

---

### 2 Types of Software That Can Be Developed
- !!Generic Products!!
  - Usually, these are standalone applications such as processors, databases, library system, etc.
- !!Customized Products!!
  - Software that are specific to customers because they have unique needs that the generic products.
  - This is where you come in as a software engineer.
  - Examples: System to support a business process such as traffic control.

---

### !!SaaS or Software As A Service!!

   style _ fill:none,stroke:none;
```

- !!Inputs and Outputs!!
  - The main aim of a system is to produce an output that is useful for its user.
  - !!Inputs!! are the information that enters into the system for processing.
  - The !!output!! is the outcome of processing.
- !!Processors!!
  - Involves the actual transformation of input into an output.
  - The operational component of a system.
  - May modify the input depending on the output specification.
  - As the output specifications change, so does the processing. In some cases, the !!input!! is also modified to enable the processor for handling the transformation.
- !!Control!!
  - It guides the system.
  - Decision-making subsystem that controls the pattern of activities governing input, processing, and output.
  - For example, in order to keep the system in balance, what and how much input is needed is determined by !!output specifications!!.
- !!Feedback!!
  - Provides control in a dynamic system.
  - !!Positive feedback!! is routine in nature that encourages the performance of the system.
  - !!Negative feedback!! is informational in nature that provides the controller with information for action.
- !!Environment!!
  - The *"supersystem"* within which an organization operates.
  - The source of external elements that strike on the system.
  - It determines how a system must function.
- !!Boundaries and Interface!!
  - A system should be defined by its boundaries.
  - !!Boundaries!! are the limits that identify its components, processes, and interrelationship when it interfaces with another system.

### Types of Systems
- !!Physical or Abstract Systems!!
  - !!Physical systems!! are tangible entities. We can touch and feel them.
  - !!Physical systems!! may be dynamic in nature.
  - !!Abstract systems!! are non-physical entities or conceptual that may be formulas, representation, or model of a real system.
- !!Open or Closed Systems!!
  - !!An open system!! must interact with its environment. It receives inputs from and delivers outputs to the outside of the system.
  - !!A closed system!! does not interact with its environment. It is isolated from environmental influences.
  - !!A **completely closed** system!! is rare in reality.

  - !!Probabilistic systems!! shows uncertain behavior. The exact output is unknown.
- !!Social, Human-Machine, Machine Systems!!
  - !!Social system!! is made up of people.
  - In !!Human-Machine systems!!, both humans and machines are involved to perform a particular task. One example is computer programming.
  - !!Machine system!! is where human interference is neglected. All tasks are performed by the machine. For example, an autonomous robot.
- !!Man-Made Information Systems!!
  - An interconnected set of information resources to manage for a particular organization under DMC !!*(Direct Management Control)*!!.
  - This system includes hardware, software, communication, data, and application for producing information according to the need of an organization.

### 3 Types of Man-Made Information Systems

  - !!Interviews!!
  - !!Questionnaires!!
  - !!Observation!!
  - !!JAD *(Joint Application Development)*!!
  - !!Document analysis!!
- A requirement is a statement of what the system must do or what characteristics *(features)* it needs to have.

---

### Requirements Elicitation Techniques
- !!Interviews!!
  - This is the most used.
- !!JAD (Joint Application Development)!!
  - A structured process in which 10-20 users meet under the direction of a facilitator skilled in JAD techniques.
  - A facilitator is a person who sets the meeting agenda and guides the discussion but does not join in as a participant.
- !!Questionnaires!!
  - Set of written questions for obtaining information from individuals.
  - We use it when there are many people involved from whom the information and opinions are needed.
- !!Document Analysis!!
  - One way of understanding the *"as-is"* existing system is to analyze the documents.
- !!Observation!!
  - The act of watching processes being performed.
  - Powerful tool in understanding the *"as-is"* system.
  - It gives the analyst the reality rather than listening to stories and descriptions during interviews or JAD sessions.

---

### 3 Types of Interview Questions (With Examples)
- !!Closed-ended!!
  - How many telephone orders are received per day?
  - How do customers place orders?
- !!Open-ended!!
  - What do you think about the way invoices are currently processed?
  - What are some of the problems you face daily?
- !!Probing questions!!
  - Why?
  - Can you give me an example? Can you explain that in more detail?

---

### Requirements Analysis Strategies
- !!Problem Analysis!!
  - Asking the users and managers to identify the problems with the *as-is* system and describe how to solve them with the *to-be* system.
- !!Root Cause Analysis!!
  - It focuses on the problems first rather than the solutions.
- !!Duration Analysis!!
  - Requires a detailed examination of the amount of time it takes to perform each process in the current *as-is* system.
  - In here, you recreate a scenario with different methods and set time on each process to see the fastest way.
- !!Activity-Based Costing!!
  - Unlike duration analysis where we measure time, here in activity-based costing, we estimate the cost associated with each process.
  - Assigning value is simple; you just examine the direct cost of labor and materials for each input.
- !!Informal Benchmarking!!
  - It refers to studying how other organizations perform a business process to learn how your organization can do something better.
- !!Outcome Analysis!!
  - Focuses on understanding the primary outcomes that provide value to customers.
- !!Technology Analysis!!
  - Starts by having the analyst and managers develop a list of essential and exciting technologies. Then the group systematically identifies how each technology could be applied to the business process and determines how the business would benefit it.
- !!Activity Elimination!!
  - The analyst and managers work together to identify how the organization could eliminate each activity in the business process, how the function could operate without it, and what effects could likely occur.

---

### !!Functional Requirements!!
- Statements of services the system should provide.
- How the system should react to inputs.
- How the system should behave in situations.

---

### !!Non-Functional Requirements!!
- Constraints on the services, or the functions offered by the system.
- They include timing constraints, development process constraints, and constraints imposed by the standards.
- May affect the overall architecture of a system rather than individual components.
- A single non-functional requirement may generate several related functional requirements.

---
